### 🔧 **Technical Architecture (3-COLUMN OPTIMIZED)**

**AAC Processing Pipeline:**
```
Audio Input → ffmpeg Convert → AAC Stream → Real ADTS Analysis → 3-Col Index → PyAV Extract
     ↓             ↓              ↓              ↓                ↓              ↓
Universal      Subprocess     ADTS Format    Native sync        OPTIMIZED     Native decode
formats        conversion     with headers   pattern parsing    3-col index   with overlap
(any → AAC)    (reliable)     (0xFFF0)      (bit-accurate)     (50% smaller) (sample-accurate)
```

**3-Column Index Structure (OPTIMIZED):**
```
Index Format: [byte_offset, frame_size, sample_pos]
              [uint64,     uint64,     uint64   ]
              [8 bytes,    8 bytes,    8 bytes  ] = 24 bytes per frame

Calculated Values (not stored):
├── sample_count: Always 1024 (get_aac_frame_samples())
├── timestamp_ms: Calculated from sample_pos + sample_rate
└── frame_flags: Not needed (all frames are keyframes)

Space Savings vs 6-Column:
├── Old format: 6 columns × 8 bytes = 48 bytes per frame
├── New format: 3 columns × 8 bytes = 24 bytes per frame
└── Reduction: 24 bytes per frame = 50% space savings
```

**Overlap Handling for Random Access:**
```
Sample Request: [start_sample, end_sample]
     ↓
Frame Detection: Binary search in sample_pos column
     ↓
Overlap Strategy: Start decode one frame earlier than needed
     ↓
PyAV Decode: Decode overlapping frames
     ↓
Sample Trimming: Cut exact sample range from decoded audio
     ↓
Result: Sample-accurate audio segment
```

**Import vs Extract Flow (3-Column Optimized):**
```
IMPORT:  Audio Files → ffmpeg subprocess → AAC Stream → Real Frame Analysis → 3-Col Index → Zarr Storage
EXTRACT: Zarr AAC → 3-Col Index lookup → Overlap calculation → PyAV decode → Sample trimming → Result
             ↓           ↓                    ↓                 ↓               ↓
        Stored data  O(log n) search    Frame overlap      Native Python   Sample-accurate
                    (24 bytes/frame)    (automatic)        fast decode     precise output
```
